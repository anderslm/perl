SUMMARY="Perform diffs on files and record sets"
DESCRIPTION="diff() provides a basic set of services akin to the GNU diff
utility. It is not anywhere near as feature complete as GNU diff, but it is
better integrated with Perl and available on all platforms. It is often faster
than shelling out to a system's diff executable for small files, and generally
slower on larger files.
Relies on Algorithm::Diff for, well, the algorithm. This may not produce the
same exact diff as a system's local diff executable, but it will be a valid diff
and comprehensible by patch. We haven't seen any differences between
Algorithm::Diff's logic and GNU diff's, but we have not examined them to make
sure they are indeed identical."
