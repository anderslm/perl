require perl-module [ module_author=DROLSKY ]

SUMMARY="Name your accessors foo() and set_foo()"
DESCRIPTION="
This module does not provide any methods. Simply loading it changes the
default naming policy for the loading class so that accessors are
separated into get and set methods. The get methods have the same name
as the accessor, while set methods are prefixed with \"set_\".
