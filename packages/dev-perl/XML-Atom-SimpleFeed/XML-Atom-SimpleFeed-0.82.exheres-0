SUMMARY="No-fuss generation of Atom syndication feeds"
DESCRIPTION="
This module provides a minimal API for generating Atom syndication feeds
quickly and easily. It supports all aspects of the Atom format, but has no
provisions for generating feeds with extension elements.  You can supply
strings for most things, and the module will provide useful defaults. When you
want more control, you can provide data structures, as documented, to specify
more particulars.
