SUMMARY="Keep imports and functions out of your namespace"
DESCRIPTION="When you define a function, or import one, into a Perl package,
it will naturally also be available as a method. This does not per se cause
problems, but it can complicate subclassing and, for example, plugin classes
that are included via multiple inheritance by loading them as base classes.
The namespace::clean pragma will remove all previously declared or imported
symbols at the end of the current package's compile cycle. Functions called
in the package itself will still be bound by their name, but they won't show
up as methods on your class or instances."
