SUMMARY="US-ASCII transliterations of Unicode text"
DESCRIPTION="
It often happens that you have non-Roman text data in Unicode, but you can't display
it - usually because you're trying to show it via an application that doesn't support
Unicode, or because the fonts you need aren't accessible.
Text::Unidecode provides a function that gives you an attempt at *transliteration*
- i. e., conveying, in Roman letters, the pronunciation expressed by the text in
some other writing system.
