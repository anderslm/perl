SUMMARY="Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval."
DESCRIPTION="
String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose uses it heavily, to
generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, which speeds code up at runtime by a
significant amount. String eval is not without its issues however - it's difficult to control the
scope it's used in (which determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it's easy to
miss compilation errors, since eval catches them and sticks them in $@ instead.

This module attempts to solve these problems. It provides an eval_closure function, which evals a
string in a clean environment, other than a fixed list of specified variables. Compilation errors
are rethrown automatically.
