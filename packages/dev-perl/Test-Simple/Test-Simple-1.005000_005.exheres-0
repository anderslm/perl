require perl-module [ module_author=MSCHWERN ]

SUMMARY="Yet another framework for writing test scripts."
DESCRIPTION="
The purpose of this module is to provide a wide range of testing utilities. Various ways to say "ok"
with better diagnostics, facilities to skip tests, test future features and compare complicated data
structures. While you can do almost anything with a simple ok() function, it doesn't provide good
diagnostic output.
