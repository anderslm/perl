require perl-module [ module_author=DROLSKY ]

SUMMARY="Loads one of several alternate underlying implementations for a module."
DESCRIPTION="
This module abstracts out the process of choosing one of several underlying implementations for a
module. This can be used to provide XS and pure Perl implementations of a module, or it could be
used to load an implementation for a given OS or any other case of needing to provide multiple
implementations.

This module is only useful when you know all the implementations ahead of time. If you want to load
arbitrary implementations then you probably want something like a plugin system, not this module.
