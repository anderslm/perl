SUMMARY="ExtUtils::Depends - Easily build XS extensions that depend on XS extensions."
DESCRIPTION="
This module tries to make it easy to build Perl extensions that use functions and typemaps provided
by other perl extensions. This means that a perl extension is treated like a shared library that
provides also a C and an XS interface besides the perl one.
