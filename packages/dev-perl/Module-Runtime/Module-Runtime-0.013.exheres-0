require perl-module [ module_author=ZEFRAM ]

SUMMARY="Runtime module handling."
DESCRIPTION="
The functions exported by this module deal with runtime handling of Perl modules, which are normally
handled at compile time. This module avoids using any other modules, so that it can be used in
low-level infrastructure.

The parts of this module that work with module names apply the same syntax that is used for
barewords in Perl source. In principle this syntax can vary between versions of Perl, and this
module applies the syntax of the Perl on which it is running. In practice the usable syntax hasn't
changed yet, but there's a good chance of it changing in Perl 5.18.

The functions of this module whose purpose is to load modules include workarounds for three old Perl
core bugs regarding require. These workarounds are applied on any Perl version where the bugs exist,
except for a case where one of the bugs cannot be adequately worked around in pure Perl.
