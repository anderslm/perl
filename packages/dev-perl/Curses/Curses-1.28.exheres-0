SUMMARY="terminal screen handling and optimization"
DESCRIPTION="
Curses is the interface between Perl and your system's curses(3)
library. For descriptions on the usage of a given function, variable, or
constant, consult your system's documentation, as such information
invariably varies (:-) between different curses(3) libraries and
operating systems. This document describes the interface itself, and
assumes that you already know how your system's curses(3) library works.
