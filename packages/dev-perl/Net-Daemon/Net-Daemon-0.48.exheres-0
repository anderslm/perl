SUMMARY="Perl extension for portable daemons "
DESCRIPTION="Net::Daemon is an abstract base class for implementing portable
server applications in a very simple way. The Net::Daemon class offers methods
for the most common tasks a daemon needs: Starting up, logging, accepting
clients, authorization, restricting its own environment for security and doing
the true work. You only have to override those methods that aren't appropriate
for you, but typically inheriting will safe you a lot of work anyways."
