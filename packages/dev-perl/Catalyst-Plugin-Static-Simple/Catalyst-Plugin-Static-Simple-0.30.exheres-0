SUMMARY="Make serving static pages in Catalyst painless"
DESCRIPTION="The Static::Simple plugin is designed to make serving static
content in your application during development quick and easy, without
requiring a single line of code from you. This plugin detects static files
by looking at the file extension in the URL (such as .css or .png or .js).
The plugin uses the lightweight MIME::Types module to map file extensions
to IANA-registered MIME types, and will serve your static files with the
correct MIME type directly to the browser, without being processed through
Catalyst."
