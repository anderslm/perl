SUMMARY="Code coverage metrics for Perl"
DESCRIPTION="
This module provides code coverage metrics for Perl. Code coverage metrics describe how thoroughly
tests exercise code. By using Devel::Cover you can discover areas of code not exercised by your
tests and determine which tests to create to increase coverage. Code coverage can be considered as
an indirect measure of quality.
