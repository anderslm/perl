SUMMARY="Definition of MIME types"
DESCRIPTION="MIME types are used in MIME compliant lines, for instance as part
of e-mail and HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is
transmitted. Sometimes real knowledge about a mime-type is need. This module
maintains a set of MIME::Type objects, which each describe one known mime type.
There are many types defined by RFCs and vendors, so the list is long but not
complete. Please don't hestitate to ask to add additional information. If you
wish to get access to the mime.types files, which are available on various
places in UNIX and Linux systems, then have a look at File::TypeInfo."
