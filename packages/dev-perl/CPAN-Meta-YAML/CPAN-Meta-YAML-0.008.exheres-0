SUMMARY="Read and write a subset of YAML for CPAN Meta files"
DESCRIPTION="
This module implements a subset of the YAML specification for use in reading and writing CPAN metadata files like META.yml and MYMETA.yml. It should not be used for any other general YAML parsing or generation task. NOTE: META.yml (and MYMETA.yml) files should be UTF-8 encoded. Users are responsible for proper encoding and decoding. In particular, the "read" and "write" methods do not support UTF-8 and should not be used.
