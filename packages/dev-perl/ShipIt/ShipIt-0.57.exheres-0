SUMMARY="software release tool"
DESCRIPTION="
Releasing a new version of software takes a lot of steps... finding the
next version number (and making sure you didn't already use that version
number before), making sure your changelog is updated, making sure your
\"make dist\" results in a tarball that builds, commiting changes (with
updated version number), tagging, and uploading the tarball somewhere.

Or maybe more steps. Or not some of the above. Maybe you forgot
something! And maybe you manage multiple projects, and each project has
a different release process.
