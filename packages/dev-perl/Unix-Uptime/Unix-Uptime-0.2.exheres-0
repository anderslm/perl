SUMMARY="Determine the current uptime, in seconds, across different *NIX architectures"
DESCRIPTION="
This is a rather simple module that abstracts the task of figuring out
the current system uptime, in seconds. It was born out of a desire to do
this on non-Linux systems, without SNMP. If you want to use SNMP, there
are pleanty of modules on CPAN already.
