SUMMARY="Drop-in replacement for dev-perl/NEXT"
DESCRIPTION="This module is intended as a drop-in replacement for NEXT (Pesudo-class for method
redispatch), supporting the same interface, but using Class::C3 to do the hard work. You can then
write new code without NEXT, and migrate individual source files to use Class::C3 or method
modifiers as appropriate, at whatever pace you're comfortable with. This module uses NEXT as a
fallback in some cases.
