SUMMARY="A fully event-driven IRC client module "
DESCRIPTION="POE::Component::IRC is a POE component (who'd have guessed?) which
acts as an easily controllable IRC client for your other POE components and
sessions. You create an IRC component and tell it what events your session
cares about and where to connect to, and it sends back interesting IRC events
when they happen. You make the client do things by sending it events. That's
all there is to it. Cool, no?
