SUMMARY="Provides an interface to ZIP archive files"
DESCRIPTION="The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create,
manipulate, read, and write Zip archive files.
Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings. Members can be
added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and enumerated. They can also
be renamed or have their dates, comments, or other attributes queried or
modified. Their data can be compressed or uncompressed as needed.
Members can be created from members in existing Zip files, or from existing
directories, files, or strings."
