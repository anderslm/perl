SUMMARY="Perl programmable DNS resolver class for offline emulation of DNS"
DESCRIPTION="
Net::DNS::Resolver::Programmable is a Net::DNS::Resolver descendant class that allows a virtual DNS
to be emulated instead of querying the real DNS. A set of static DNS records may be supplied, or
arbitrary code may be specified as a means for retrieving DNS records, or even generating them on
the fly.
