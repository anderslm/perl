SUMMARY="A curses based OO user interface framework"
DESCRIPTION="
Curses::UI is an object-oriented user interface framework for Perl.

It contains basic widgets (like buttons and text areas), more
\"advanced\" widgets (like UI tabs and a fully-functional basic text
editor), and some higher-level classes like pre-fab error dialogues.

See Curses::UI::Tutorial and the examples directory of the source
distribution for more introductory material.
