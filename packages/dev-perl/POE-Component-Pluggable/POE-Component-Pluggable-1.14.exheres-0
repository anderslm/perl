SUMMARY="A base class for creating plugin enabled POE Components"
DESCRIPTION="POE::Component::Pluggable is a base class for creating plugin
enabled POE Components. It is a generic port of POE::Component::IRC's plugin
system. If your component dispatches events to registered POE sessions, then
POE::Component::Pluggable may be a good fit for you. Basic use would involve
subclassing POE::Component::Pluggable, then overriding _pluggable_event() and
inserting _pluggable_process() wherever you dispatch events from. Users of
your component can then load plugins using the plugin methods provided to
handle events generated by the component. You may also use plugin style
handlers within your component as _pluggable_process() will attempt to process
any events with local method calls first. The return value of these handlers
has the same significance as the return value of 'normal' plugin handlers.
