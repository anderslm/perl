SUMMARY="Self Contained RDBMS in a DBI Driver"
DESCRIPTION="SQLite is a public domain RDBMS database engine that you can find
at http://www.hwaci.com/sw/sqlite/.
Rather than ask you to install SQLite first, because SQLite is public domain,
DBD::SQLite includes the entire thing in the distribution. So in order to get a
fast transaction capable RDBMS working for your perl project you simply have to
install this module, and nothing else."
