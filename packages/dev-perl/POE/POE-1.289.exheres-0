SUMMARY="Portable multitasking and networking framework for Perl"
DESCRIPTION="POE is a framework for cooperative, event driven multitasking and
networking in Perl. POE originally was developed as the core of a persistent
object server and runtime environment. It has since evolved into something much
more generic and widely useful. POE provides a unified interface for several
other event loops, including select(), IO::Poll, Glib, Gtk, Tk, Wx, Gtk2, and
so on. POE is designed in layers, each building atop the lower level ones.
Programs are free to use POE at any level of abstraction, and different levels
can be mixed and matched seamlessly within a single program."
