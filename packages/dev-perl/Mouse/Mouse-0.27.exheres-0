SUMMARY="A lightweight version of the Moose framework"
DESCRIPTION="Moose is wonderful. Unfortunately, it's a little slow. Though
significant progress has been made over the years, the compile time penalty
is a non-starter for some applications. Mouse aims to alleviate this by
providing a subset of Moose's functionality, faster. In particular, 'has' in
Moose is missing only a few expert-level features. We're also going as light
on dependencies as possible. Class::Method::Modifiers or Data::Util is
required if you want support for 'before', 'after', and 'around'"
